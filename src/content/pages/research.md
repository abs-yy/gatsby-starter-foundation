## Cellular stress 
  Living organisms are exposed to various stresses throughout their life cycles. They have evolved various mechanisms to protect themselves from the damage, or repair sustained damage. Various organisms have evolved tolerance against [extreme environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile); *i.e.* environemnts that we humans normally do not encounter at a daily basis. Commonly known environemnts are: High and low temperature (Thermophiles, Psychrophiles), acidic and alkaline (Acidophile, Alkaliphile), aigh and low pressures (Piezophile), salt conditions (Halophile), metal ions (Metallotolerant), osmotic pressure (Osmophile), radiation (Radioresistant), and desiccation (Xerophile). Cells constantly affected by these environments require molecular mechanisms to endure and proliferate; studying these mechanisms allow us to understand the robustness cells have.
  
  Famous extremophiles are bacterial species, such as the radiotolerant *Deinococcus radiodurans*<sup>1</sup>, capable of tolerating >5000 Gy gamma rays. Single cell organisms, compaired to multi-cell species, have relatively higher tolerance since they do not have tissues comprised from differentiated cells. However, several species have been reported to have high capabilites compaired to general eukaryotes. 

## Tardigrades 
  We have been focusing on the ecdyozoan animal, Tardigrades. Terrestrial Tardigrade species are famous for their capabiliteis of tolerating complete desiccation, a phenonemon called anhydrobiosis. Anhydrobiosis is on of a latent state of life (Cryptobiosis); others include cryobiosis (low tempretures), anoxybiosis (low oxigen levels), osmobiosis (Osmotic pressure), and Chemobiosis (high levels of toxins), which tardigrades are capable of entering all states. Anhydrobiotic individuals are known to tolerate various environmental states, i.e. high and low pressures and tempreture, alchohols, ultraviolet lights, radiation, and even vacumue space. 
  
  As tardigrades are a "non-model organism", studies on these organisms were limited to zoological and ecological methods. The first rearing method for tardigrades were established at 2009 by Atsushi Suzuki for the *Milneisum tardigradum* (currently *Milnesium inseptum*), and was followed by Daiki D. Horikawa for *Ramazzottius varieornatus*. Establishment of rearing methods enabled more sophisticated studies, such as omics analysis. One of the first omics based studies were conducted on *R. varieornatus* and had identified several tardigrade specific anhydrobiosis related genes. Now, the genome and transcriptome assemblies  have been published. These data have allowed a phylum-wide analysis of the conservation of anhydrobiosis related genes.

## Research aims
  We have employed omics based analysis to understand the mechanisms underlying anhydrobiosis mainly in Eutardigrades. I  first contributed to the comparative genomics of *R. varieornatus* and *Hypsibius exemplaris*. Using these genomic data, I further conducted transcriptome analysis of the developmental stages of these species. We are now proceeding with more omics based screening of genes contributing to anhydrobiosis and functional analysis of these genes.
  
  
## RESEARCH INTERESTS
### Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of non-model organisms
The establishment of high-throughput sequencing has enabled omics-based analyses of organisms once considered “non-model”. We encounter many fascinating phenomena in these non-model organisms, and genomic sequencing has become a necessity in order to understand their molecular basis. I have undertaken genomic analysis in Tardigrades in order to understand the mechanisms behind a phenomenon called anhydrobiosis; a latent state of life (Yoshida et al. 2017, PLoS Biol.) and in spiders to clarify the protein content of spider silk (Kono et al., 2018, Sci. Rep.). Additionally, I have contributed to the establishment of a method to sequence the genome (<100pg DNA) and transcriptome (<10ng RNA) from a single individual (Arakawa and Yoshida et al. 2016, PNAS; Yoshida et al., 2018, JoVE). 

### Detection of horizontal gene transfer in newly sequenced genomes
When a new genome is sequenced, many studies suggest the possibility of horizontal gene transfer. However, many of these identifications occur due to genomic contamination and prediction errors. In tardigrades, a previous study had found that 17% of the genome was of HGT origin, of which we identified that the majority was due to contamination. Furthermore, we reviewed previous HGT detection methods and found that novel gene prediction methods have false positive gene predictions that are detected as HGTs (Yoshida et al. 2017, PLoS Biol.; Yoshida et al., 2019, Horizontal Gene Transfer: Breaking Borders Between Living Kingdoms).

### Evolution of cellular adaptation to extreme environments
Living organisms have evolved to their habitats, including many high-stress environments. Various micro-organisms have acquired tolerance to complete desiccation, a phenomenon known as anhydrobiosis. By employing genomic and transcriptomic analyses established in our previous study, we have identified several novel candidate genes that may contribute to the molecular mechanism (Yoshida et al., 2017, PLoS Biol.). We have found that several of these candidates contribute to anti-oxidative stress in when expressed in human cell lines (Yoshida et al. 2020, in prep). 

### Embryogenesis of desiccation tolerant tardigrades
Adaptation to extreme environments in tardigrades has led to variances in tardigrade embryogenesis, and it is hypothesized that this might ensure the embryo could hatch in better conditions. By combining transcriptomics analysis and zoological validations, we found that the arthropod molting pathway may affect embryo hatching (Yoshida and Sugiura et al., 2019, BMC Dev. Biol.).
